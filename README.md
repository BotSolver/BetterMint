<h2 align="center">üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Important</h2>

<p align="center">Just so you know, I'm not claiming to be the original wizard behind this extension. The first developer was thedemons ([GitHub](https://github.com/thedemons)), but it seems they've left the project to us mere mortals. So, while I work my magic on updates, let's keep the spirit alive and show some support to the original wizard!</p>

<h1 align="center">üîÆ Features</h1>

<p align="center">Behold the magical arsenal of **BetterMint**:</p>

<p align="center">
  <ul>
    <li>**Depth**: Dive deep into the chess cosmos! Determine the maximum depth to which the engine will search during its analysis. Increasing the depth is like consulting a chess sage‚Äîit provides a more thorough analysis but may demand a few more cups of coffee as it requires extra computation time. Remember, shortcuts won't make you a grandmaster!</li>
    <li>**Skill Level**: The chess engine's secret sauce! Control the engine's playing strength with the flick of a wand. It affects move selection, evaluation, and even the mystical search parameters. Higher values make the engine stronger, while lower values grant it the gentle touch of a novice. Cheating won't turn you into a chess legend!</li>
    <li>**Lines**: Unveil the many paths of chess enlightenment! Determine the number of principal variations the engine will share during its analysis. This is like reading the thoughts of a grandmaster, showing you the engine's top moves and evaluations. Get ready to explore new dimensions and strategies‚Äîthe only true path to victory!</li>
    <li>**Threads**: Unleash the power of parallel dimensions! Specify the number of CPU threads the engine can utilize for analysis. More threads are like summoning multiple chess wizards to speed up the search and analysis, performing an intricate dance of computation. But remember, it's not about quantity; it's about quality!</li>
    <li>**NNUE**: Enter the realm of neural chess! "Efficiently Updatable Neural Network" (NNUE) is like the crystal ball of Stockfish. It's a neural network used for position evaluation, providing spellbindingly accurate assessments of positions that would leave even Kasparov in awe. But no neural network can replace true chess knowledge!</li>
    <li>**Auto Move Time**: Master the art of time manipulation! This enchanting feature uses mathematics from all the delay settings to determine the perfect moment for the auto move to make its move. It's like controlling time itself, but with chess pieces. Keep in mind that time manipulation won't make you a true chess master!</li>
    <li>**Mate Finder**: Seek the elusive checkmate with ease! Our Mate Finder is like the treasure map to the golden victory. It tirelessly hunts for the fastest path to checkmate from your current position, turning you into a chess hero! Just remember, learning to checkmate on your own is the real triumph!</li>
    <li>**Random Best Move**: Add a dash of unpredictability! This feature makes the auto move choose a random best move from its list, adding a sprinkle of chaos to make it appear more natural. Your opponents won't know what hit them! But remember, randomness won't make you a better chess player!</li>
    <li>**Legit Auto Move**: Sit back and watch the show! This magical feature automates your moves while emulating a legitimate player. It introduces delightful mistakes and enchanting inaccuracies along the way, making every game a unique adventure. But using this to avoid learning? Well, that's like trying to win a sword fight with a rubber chicken!</li>
    <li>**Show Hints**: Unlock the chess oracle's wisdom! Display the moves you can make from best to worst based on the engine's depth of analysis. It's like having a chess tutor in your ear, guiding you to victory. Remember, hints are just that‚Äîhints. The real mastery comes from understanding the game!</li>
    <li>**Text-to-Speech**: Turn moves into spoken spells! This feature transforms the moves into spoken words, allowing you to act legitimately while streaming or playing. For example, it can say "a2 a4." Please note that the incantations are in UCI format (e.g., e2e4 means pawn to e4 in the starting position). But don't use it as a crutch‚Äîreal chess legends speak through their moves!</li>
    <li>**Move Analysis**: Get a taste of the chess wizard's critique! Receive feedback on the quality of your moves or your opponent's moves. It's like having a chess mentor who whispers secrets to you during the game. But remember, learning from your moves is the real magic!</li>
    <li>**Depth Bar**: Witness the magic unfold! The Depth Bar shows the progress of the engine's analysis, illuminating the path to enlightenment. It reveals when the engine's wisdom has reached its peak. Just remember, progress is made by learning, not just watching the bar fill up!</li>
    <li>**Evaluation Bar**: Discover the hidden secrets of your position! The Evaluation Bar displays the mystical evaluation of the current game position, unveiling whether you're on the path to victory or teetering on the edge of defeat. It's your guide through the chess labyrinth. But don't rely on it; trust your own chess instincts!</li>
  </ul>

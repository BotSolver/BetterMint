<h2 align="center">🧙‍♂️ Important</h2>

<p align="center">Just so you know, I'm not claiming to be the original wizard behind this extension. The first developer was thedemons ([GitHub](https://github.com/thedemons)), but it seems they've left the project to us mere mortals. So, while I work my magic on updates, let's keep the spirit alive and show some support to the original wizard!</p>

<h1 align="center">🔮 Features</h1>

<p align="center">Behold the magical arsenal of BetterMint:</p>
